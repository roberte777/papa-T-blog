Ladies and gentlemen, hold on to your taste buds because we've got a wild ride
ahead of us. The 7Up Biscuit Challenge has taken TikTok by storm and it's time
for a reality check. I know, I know, you're thinking, "But Papa T, how could
something that looks so good be so bad?" Well, I'm here to tell you that
the TikTok lies.

As a seasoned foodie and master of the "people mover" rating system, I can tell
you that the 7Up Biscuit Challenge only gets a measly 1 out of 4 people movers.
That's right, just one. I know, I know, the pictures look amazing, but trust me,
the taste is not worth the time or ingredients.

So what exactly is the 7Up Biscuit Challenge? It's a biscuit recipe that calls
for Bisquick and 7Up soda. Sounds simple enough, right? Wrong. The end result is
a flavorless, dry, and crumbly mess. No amount of jam, butter, or gravy can
save this disaster.

So, my friends, if you're looking for a tasty biscuit, skip the 7Up Biscuit
Challenge and try one of my favorite recipes instead. The world of food is full
of delicious possibilities, don't waste your time on this trend.

TikTok lies, folks, and the 7Up Biscuit Challenge is proof. Don't say I
didn't warn you.
