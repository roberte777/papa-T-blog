Ladies and gentlemen, hold on to your taste buds because we've got a wild ride
ahead of us. The 7 biscuit trend has taken TikTok by storm and it's time for a
reality check. I know, I know, you're thinking, "But Papa T, how could
something that looks so good be so bad?" Well, I'm here to tell you that the
TikTok lies.

As a seasoned foodie and master of the "people mover" rating system, I can tell
you that the 7 biscuit trend only gets a measly 1 out of 4 people movers.
That's right, just one. I know, I know, the pictures look amazing, but trust
me, the taste is not worth the time or ingredients.

So what exactly is the 7 biscuit trend? It's a stack of seven biscuits that
are stacked on top of each other and then filled with various sweet and savory
fillings. Sounds simple enough, right? Wrong. The end result is a flavorless,
dry, and crumbly mess. No amount of jam, butter, or gravy can save this disaster.

So, my friends, if you're looking for a tasty treat, skip the 7 biscuits and
try one of my favorite recipes instead. The world of food is full of delicious
possibilities, don't waste your time on this trend.

TikTok lies, folks, and the 7 biscuit trend is proof. Don't say I didn't warn you.
